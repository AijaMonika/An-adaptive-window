## Project Description

In this practical work on "Adaptive Data Processing Systems," an adaptive information system was developed that adjusts to user choices. This system was designed to meet the needs of the RTU MISIK VNPC radar group, providing efficient data collection and storage.

A software prototype was created in Python using the Tkinter library. The prototype includes an adaptive data entry form that changes based on user selections. The user can choose various data formats, such as images, Excel files, pseudocode, or links, and the corresponding data entry window will open according to the selected format. The system supports the addition of multiple types of attachments and automatically generates a descriptive .txt file for the data.

The user is offered the option to select or create a new project name under which the data will be stored. Each project is assigned a separate folder, and each data set is given its own folder within the project's folder. This approach ensures structured and organized data storage.

## Prototype Functionality

The prototype offers the following functionalities:

1. **Adaptive Data Entry Form Creation**: The form adapts based on user selections.
2. **Data Format Selection**: The user can select a data format (image, Excel file, pseudocode, link), and the corresponding data entry window will open.
3. **Specifying the Number of Attachments**: The user can specify the number of attachments, which determines how many times the data entry window will open.
4. **Project Name Selection or Creation**: The user can choose an existing project name or create a new project.
5. **Data Name Entry**: The entered data name is used to create a separate folder for each data set.
6. **Short Data Description Entry**: The user can add a short description of the data, and all data are automatically saved in a .txt file.

This project provides structured and efficient data collection and storage, which is essential for the research and project development of the RTU radar group.
